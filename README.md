# ðŸ›’ QuickCart

**QuickCart** is my first E-Commerce website project â€” a simple start to something much bigger!

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project began using only **HTML** â€” no CSS, no JavaScript â€” just clean and simple markup.

It's my starting point to learn, grow, and eventually build a complete online shopping experience.

## Updates:


Added a CSS file, and applied the Css styles to the most of the pages.

Wrote the first structure using only HTML.

## ðŸ“Œ Why QuickCart?

Because every great dev starts somewhere â€” and this is mine.  
**QuickCart** is more than a project â€” it's my personal learning journey.

# 🛒 QuickCart

**QuickCart** is my first E-Commerce website project — a simple start to something much bigger!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project began using only **HTML** — no CSS, no JavaScript — just clean and simple markup.

It's my starting point to learn, grow, and eventually build a complete online shopping experience.

## 🛠️ What's Next?

As I continue to learn, I plan to:
- 💅 Add **CSS** for styling and layout
- ⚙️ Use **JavaScript** for interactivity
- 🧠 Improve the design to make it more professional

## 📌 Why QuickCart?

Because every great dev starts somewhere — and this is mine.  
**QuickCart** is more than a project — it's my personal learning journey.
